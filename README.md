# Reflection 

The final project and test helped me understand Agile methodology more deeply. By creating a project from the very first day, I was able to grasp the concepts and apply them correctly with the guidance of my professor, Justino. I learned how to organize my project using GitHub, work with Git version control, apply Scrum through Jira, and incorporate AI to assist with anything needed throughout the development process.
